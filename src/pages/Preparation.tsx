      question: "Is ceremonial work right for me?",
      answer: "Ceremonial work can be beneficial for many individuals, but it's not for everyone at every time. Those with certain mental health conditions, those in crisis, or those taking specific medications may need to wait or explore other options. This is why a preliminary conversation is required before participating in any ceremony."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I bring to a ceremony?",
      answer: "For most ceremonies, you'll want to bring comfortable clothing, a journal, any sacred objects you'd like to have with you, and an open heart. Specific ceremonies may have additional suggested items, which will be shared in your preparation materials."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I've never participated in ceremony before?",
      answer: "Many participants are new to ceremonial work, and the experiences are designed to be accessible to beginners. Additional support is provided for first-time participants, and there's never any pressure to participate in any aspect of ceremony that doesn't feel right for you."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I be safe during the ceremony?",
      answer: "Safety is my highest priority. Physical, emotional, and spiritual safety measures are carefully implemented in all ceremonial spaces. You will never be pressured to do anything that doesn't feel right for you, and experienced support staff are present for all group ceremonies."
    },
    {
      question: "What can I expect after a ceremony?",
      answer: "After a ceremony, many participants experience a sense of openness, clarity, or transformation. Some may also feel emotional, tired, or need time for processing. This is why integration support is so important. You'll receive guidance on how to care for yourself following ceremony and how to integrate insights into your daily life."

                      <p className="text-eagle-blue-700">
                        After ceremony, prioritize gentle self-care: adequate rest, nourishing food, time 
                        in nature, and minimal screen time. Allow yourself space to process without immediately 
                        returning to the usual pace of life.

                      <p className="text-eagle-blue-700">
                        Many find that creative expressionâ€”through art, music, dance, or writingâ€”helps 
                        process and integrate ceremonial experiences. Even if you don't consider yourself 
                        artistic, simple creative expression can access wisdom that might elude linear thinking.

                        insights at the physical level, bringing ceremony's benefits into your lived experience.
